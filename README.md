Add a file in the body.

#### Responses:

- **201**: The content was uploaded OK. This will response the path of the file
```
{
    "path": [
        "uploaded/32x32_gffwqcloxmkhqmt.png",
        "uploaded/64x64_gffwqcloxmkhqmt.png",
        "uploaded/32x32_kpaqatoxdkjkzpr.png",
        "uploaded/64x64_kpaqatoxdkjkzpr.png",
        "uploaded/32x32_owzypzzbgbikeud.png",
        "uploaded/64x64_owzypzzbgbikeud.png"
    ],
    "response": "file(s) uploaded successfully.",
    "status": 201
}
```

Image will not be modified and will be saved as it is.
